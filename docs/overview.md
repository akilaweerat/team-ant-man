### User Access and Role-based Experience
SmartCart will support two distinct user types:

* **Store Administrators**: Have access to tools for managing product listings and order fulfillment.
This role-based access ensures a focused and secure experience tailored to each user's needs.

### Product Discovery and Browse
Customers will be greeted with a clean and organized display of products, each featuring **basic details** like name, pricing, and an image. Users can easily locate items through:
* **Keyword search**.
* **Filters** (e.g., category).

### Shopping Cart Management
Customers can add desired items to a personal shopping cart, a temporary collection space for review before purchase. Users can:

The checkout area summarizes the order and collects essential transaction information. This includes:
